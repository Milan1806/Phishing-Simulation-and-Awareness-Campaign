# Phishing Simulation and Awareness Campaign — Demo

## Overview
This is a **safe, synthetic demo** of a phishing awareness campaign workflow. It demonstrates how phishing simulations combined with targeted awareness training can **improve user resilience** against social engineering attacks.  
**All data is synthetic** — no real users or credentials are included.

## Key Features
- **Email Templates:** Realistic phishing emails (HR, IT, incentive lures).  
- **Training Landing Page:** Safe page to educate users on phishing.  
- **Engagement Metrics:** 200 synthetic users with pre/post training click behavior.  
- **Analysis Scripts:** Python scripts to generate metrics and visualizations.  
- **Reports & Slides:** Example materials demonstrating campaign impact.

## Demo Results (Synthetic)
- Initial simulated click-through rate: **40%**  
- Post-training simulated click-through rate: **26%**  
- Relative reduction: **35%**

## Skills Highlighted
- Phishing simulation planning  
- Security awareness campaign design  
- Data analysis & visualization  
- Reporting & portfolio presentation

## How to Use
1. Check email templates in `campaigns/email_templates/`  
2. Open `analysis/metrics_anonymized.csv`  
3. Run `scripts/analyze_metrics.py` to reproduce metrics  
4. Explore `slides/` and `reports/` for example awareness content

## Ethics & Safety
- This repo is **fully synthetic and safe** for public sharing.  
- Do **not** run phishing simulations against real users without authorization.
