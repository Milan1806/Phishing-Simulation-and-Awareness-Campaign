Phishing Simulation and Awareness Campaign — Demo
Overview
This is a safe, synthetic demo showcasing a phishing awareness campaign workflow. It demonstrates how phishing simulations combined with targeted awareness training can improve user resilience against social engineering attacks. All data and examples are fully synthetic — no real users, credentials, or sensitive information are included.

Key Features

Email Templates: Realistic phishing emails with placeholders, including HR notifications, IT alerts, and incentive-based lures.

Training Landing Page: Safe, interactive page designed to educate users on recognizing phishing attempts.

Engagement Metrics: Anonymized dataset of 200 synthetic users with pre- and post-training simulated click behavior.

Analysis Scripts: Python scripts to generate visualizations and calculate click-rate reduction across control and training cohorts.

Reports & Slides: Example awareness session slides and a summary report showing the campaign’s impact.

Demo Results (Synthetic)

Initial simulated click-through rate: 40%
